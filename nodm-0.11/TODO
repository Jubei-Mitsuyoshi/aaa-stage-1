xauth:
  01:48 #openmoko-debian < lindi-> enrico: hmm, http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=595750 is still open?
  01:53 #openmoko-debian < lindi-> enrico: just generating cookiefile to to some /var/lib/nodm/ and using it in Xorg 
                                   -auth and $XAUTHORITY should fix it
  01:56 #openmoko-debian < enrico> lindi-: the bug is still open but it's indeed ripe for closing; only, I do not know 
                                   how that machinery works
  01:57 #openmoko-debian < lindi-> gdm3 _create_xauth_file_for_user has all the details
  01:57 #openmoko-debian < enrico> progress: after testing the display manaager on my freerunner and seeing that it 
                                   works, I've now merged my branch on master
  01:57 #openmoko-debian < lindi-> as you can guess, lots of paranoid checks :)
  01:57 #openmoko-debian < lindi-> *cookie = gdm_generate_random_bytes (GDM_DISPLAY_ACCESS_COOKIE_SIZE, &add_error);
  01:59 #openmoko-debian < enrico> lindi-: neat, sounds doable. I now have full control over the X command line in a 
                                   very cool way
  01:59 #openmoko-debian < lindi-> enrico: but I kind of like how gdm3 does it. for example now I have 
                                   /var/run/gdm3/auth-for-lindi-uoAyyh/database
  02:00 #openmoko-debian < enrico> lindi-: mind if I write it to $HOME/.Xauthority ? I rather not having to maintain a 
                                   custom dir structure on /var/run for nodm
  02:00 #openmoko-debian < lindi-> enrico: I kind of like gdm3 approach more, writing to $HOME is ugly. since user can  
                                   use it on multiple machines you need to merge the stuff
  02:00 #openmoko-debian < lindi-> enrico: you can't just overwrite .Xauthority
  02:00 #openmoko-debian < enrico> lindi-: oh merge the stuff ouch
  02:00 #openmoko-debian < lindi-> enrico: you also don't want to infinitely concatenate it
  02:00 #openmoko-debian < enrico> lindi-: I see the point
  02:00 #openmoko-debian < lindi-> and think of locking, nfs
  02:01 #openmoko-debian < lindi-> gdm-display-access-file.c in gdm3 sources has all the logic
oppure fare uno script da sourciare prima di far partire X
